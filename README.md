# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview
This project is a clone of the popular AirBnB platform. It replicates core functionalities such as property listing, user authentication, booking, and reviews. The goal is to develop a scalable and responsive full-stack application for educational and portfolio purposes.

## Project Goals
- Recreate a simplified version of the AirBnB platform
- Implement both front-end and back-end functionality
- Practice full-stack development with modern tools
- Learn clean code structure, version control, and collaboration

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React (later)
- **Backend**: Python, Flask (or Django)
- **Database**: MySQL / PostgreSQL
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Deployment**: (Optional) Heroku / Render / Docker

# AirBnB Clone Project

=======
## Team Roles

In this project, our team was structured around key software development roles to ensure smooth collaboration and delivery of an Airbnb clone application.

### 1. **Backend Developer**
Responsible for building the server-side logic, APIs, and core functionality. Handles user authentication, listing management, and reservation processes. Also ensures data is correctly transferred between the client and the server.

### 2. **Frontend Developer**
Focuses on implementing the user interface and user experience using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or frontend frameworks). Integrates APIs and ensures a responsive and user-friendly design across devices.

### 3. **Database Administrator (DBA)**
Designs and manages the project's database structure. Responsible for ensuring data integrity, indexing, writing efficient SQL queries, and handling backups and migrations.

### 4. **DevOps Engineer**
Sets up and maintains deployment pipelines, manages cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Heroku), and ensures continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). Handles server configuration, monitoring, and scalability.

### 5. **Project Manager**
Coordinates the team, tracks progress, assigns tasks, and ensures milestones are met. Acts as a liaison between stakeholders and developers to keep everyone aligned.

### 6. **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer**
Tests the application for bugs and performance issues. Writes test cases and automates test suites to ensure the stability and reliability of the system across updates.


## Technology Stack

Below is a list of the core technologies used in this project and their respective roles:

### 1. **Django**
A high-level Python web framework used for building the backend of the application. It enables rapid development of secure and maintainable web APIs and views.

### 2. **PostgreSQL**
An open-source, advanced relational database used to store application data such as users, listings, bookings, and payments. It integrates well with Django using the ORM.

### 3. **HTML/CSS**
Used to create and style the frontend pages. HTML structures the content while CSS makes it visually appealing and responsive.

### 4. **JavaScript**
Adds interactivity to the frontend (e.g., date pickers, form validation, dynamic content loading).

### 5. **Bootstrap**
A frontend framework used to speed up UI development with pre-designed responsive components.

### 6. **REST Framework (Django REST Framework)**
Used to create RESTful APIs for the backend. Allows data exchange between frontend and backend in JSON format.

### 7. **Docker** *(Optional if used)*
Used to containerize the application for easy deployment and environment consistency.

### 8. **Git & GitHub**
Version control system and platform for code collaboration and project tracking.
