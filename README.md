### 4. **DevOps Engineer**
Sets up and maintains deployment pipelines, manages cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Heroku), and ensures continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). Handles server configuration, monitoring, and scalability.

### 5. **Project Manager**
Coordinates the team, tracks progress, assigns tasks, and ensures milestones are met. Acts as a liaison between stakeholders and developers to keep everyone aligned.

### 6. **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer**
Tests the application for bugs and performance issues. Writes test cases and automates test suites to ensure the stability and reliability of the system across updates.
